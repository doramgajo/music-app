**Music** is an audio player application. It offers the basics of any music
player: change songs, shuffle, repeat...

The project was built using **Kotlin** in **Android Studio**.

> [!NOTE]  
This application was developed during my time as a student, under a tight
deadline and while managing other projects. It offers the core functionality,
but you may encounter bugs, rough edges, and code thatâ€™s not production-ready.
